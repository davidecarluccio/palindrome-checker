# palindrome-checker
Build a palindrome checker that verifies if a word or phrase is a palindrome, ignoring punctuation, spaces, and case. The app should include an input field, a button to check the input, and a result display. The app will alert users if the input is empty and return whether the input is a palindrome or not based on the cleaned version of the string.
